14/12/2022: State Trace Update
-------------------------------
By "State Trace", we mean a way of updating in which all states in a "chain" of actions recieve the same update. For example, if in state s action a1 is taken, then in state s+a1 action a2 is taken, and then in state s + a1 + a2 no action is taken, then the update rule performed for s+a1+a2 is also "fed back" and done for s and s+a1, replacing the previous approach which simply used updates of V(s+a1) for s, and V(s+a1+a2) for s+a1.

Additionally, update targets c + E{V(s')} - V(s0) or c + E{V(s')} - gt have been replaced by c + E{V(s')} - V(s0) - gt in the Cont-AVI and Cont-APE algorithms; this seems to lead to better VFAs. This is done in both the old algorithms for AVI and APE, and for the new algorithms that implement the state trace. ContApprox has been deprecated, as it doesn't make sense to approximate E{V(s')} when we need to calculate it for the passive action anyway, so we now have just AVI-Cont and AVI-Cont-ST. However, APE-FA-ContApprox remains in use, as this doesn't require the calculation of expected values to find actions. State Trace versions of both APE-Cont algorithms have been implemented.

We also introduce gEvaluationContFixed, which takes a parameter g0 which replaces g in the action selection, so that the same policy is used throughout. We also include gEvaluationContFA to evaluate the FA policy via simulation.

Some investigation in Exact DP reveals that, in some situations, the value function can in fact become negative. Such a situation can be constructed as follows: consider the 5 link inhomogeneous problem. Create a policy which is fully passive when link 3 is healthy, and is close to optimal (or at least reasonable) when 3 is damaged, and never repairs 3. Starting in state s0 = (1,1,1,1,1) then means we have to "suffer through" the use of a bad policy until link 3 becomes broken, past which we never repair 3 and use a much better policy. State (1,1,3,1,1) therefore becomes better than s0, and therefore recieves a negative value function when s0 is the reference state. Due to this investigation, the rules in the AVI/APE functions which ensured update targets vHat became max(vHat,0) have been removed.
